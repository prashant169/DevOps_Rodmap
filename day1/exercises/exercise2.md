# Day 1 Exercise 2: Branching and Merging

In this exercise, you will practice branching and merging in Git. Follow the instructions below to complete the exercise.

## Instructions

1. Make sure you are in the same repository directory from Exercise 1.

2. Check the current branches in the repository using the `git branch` command.

3. Create a new branch called `feature` using the `git branch` command.

4. Switch to the `feature` branch using the `git checkout` command.

5. Create a new file called `feature.txt` in the repository directory and add some content to it.

6. Use the `git status` command to check the status of the repository. Observe that the new file is listed as an untracked file.

7. Add the `feature.txt` file to the staging area using the `git add` command.

8. Commit the changes with an appropriate commit message.

9. Switch back to the main branch using the `git checkout` command.

10. Merge the changes from the `feature` branch into the main branch using the `git merge` command.

11. Resolve any merge conflicts, if any arise during the merge process.

12. Confirm that the changes from the `feature` branch are now incorporated into the main branch.

Congratulations! You have completed the exercise and practiced branching and merging in Git.

## Further Challenge (Optional)

If you want an additional challenge, try the following:

- Create another branch called `bugfix` from the main branch.
- Switch to the `bugfix` branch.
- Make some changes to an existing file in the repository.
- Commit the changes on the `bugfix` branch.
- Switch back to the main branch.
- Merge the changes from the `bugfix` branch into the main branch.
- Verify that the bug fixes from the `bugfix` branch are now included in the main branch.

This exercise will help you gain hands-on experience with branching, merging, and resolving merge conflicts.

Remember to experiment, make mistakes, and learn from them. Happy coding!
