# Day 1 Exercise 1: Basic Git Commands

In this exercise, you will practice using basic Git commands to initialize a repository, make commits, and check the repository status. Follow the instructions below to complete the exercise.

## Instructions

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.

2. Create a new directory for this exercise and navigate into it using the following commands:

mkdir exercise1
cd exercise1


3. Initialize a new Git repository using the `git init` command.

4. Create a new file called `hello.txt` in the repository directory and add some content to it.

5. Use the `git status` command to check the status of the repository. Observe that the new file is listed as an untracked file.

6. Add the `hello.txt` file to the staging area using the `git add` command.

7. Run `git status` again and notice that the file is now listed as a new file to be committed.

8. Make a commit with a descriptive message using the `git commit` command.

9. Modify the content of the `hello.txt` file.

10. Run `git status` and observe that the modified file is listed as a modified file.

11. Stage the modified file using `git add`.

12. Commit the changes with an appropriate commit message.

Congratulations! You have completed the exercise and practiced basic Git commands for initializing a repository, making commits, and checking the repository status.

## Further Challenge (Optional)

If you want an additional challenge, try the following:

- Create a new branch using the `git branch` command.
- Switch to the new branch using the `git checkout` command.
- Make some changes to the `hello.txt` file in the new branch.
- Commit the changes on the new branch.
- Switch back to the main branch.
- Merge the changes from the new branch into the main branch using the `git merge` command.

This exercise will give you hands-on experience with branching and merging, which we will cover in more detail in Day 2.

Remember to experiment, make mistakes, and learn from them. Happy coding!
